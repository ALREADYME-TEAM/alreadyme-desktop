# README #

## What this means

Couldn't find the documentation, or, if found, it's outdated, so I'm just listing the functions in the current state. Also, Rational UI doesn't seem to have the functionality below yet (modal, etc...).

This was one of the last projects written for me. Maybe I learn a little more on how to code software now. And, as long as I can make something that works, it is taken as a bit of fun.

## Are you interested in this?
